# Bash File Manager

A simple yet powerful terminal-based file manager written in Bash for managing files and directories efficiently. Inspired by modern file managers like `lf`, this script provides a minimalist and user-friendly interface for performing common file management tasks in the terminal environment.

## Features
- List files and directories with color-coded icons for easy identification.
- Create, delete, copy, and move files and directories with intuitive commands.
- View detailed file information, including permissions, size, and modification time.
- Search for files by name within the current directory and its subdirectories.
- Edit text files using the Nano text editor directly from the file manager.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the `bf.sh` script.
2. Make the script executable with `chmod +x bf.sh`.
3. Run the script with `./bf.sh` and follow the on-screen instructions to navigate directories and perform file management tasks.
